				The Web is made of HTML pages connected by URLs.
				<br>
				<br>
				HTML: HyperText markup language.
				<br>
				Text content: what you see.
				<br>
				Markup: what it looks like.
				<br>
				Reference to other documents: eg images or videos.

				a TAG is contained in angled brackets, and in HTML we have an opening TAG and a closing TAG.
				<br>
				<br>
				a void TAG is a TAG that does not require a closing TAG.
				<br>
				<br>
				an Element is the opening and closing TAGs and the content between them.
				<br>
				<br>
				Attributes are Tags that include some "value" or reference to a website or an image or etc.
				<br>
				<br>
				Container elements: elements that do nothing but contain stuff inside of them.

					HTML and CSS develop and change over time, but the underlying principles always remain the same.
					<br>
					<br>
					We can think of an HTML file like we think of a house:
					<br>
					<br>
					- HTML is the structure of the house like where the walls are placed, the rooms, kitchen.. Etc.
					<br>
					- CSS is the style of the house like the decoration, the colors of the walls.. Etc.
					<br>
					- JAVA script files are the interactive components, like the garage door opener, the remote control.. Etc.

				DOM: Document Object Model. a tree like structure.
				<br>
				<br>
				The browser builds a Tree like structure of the page. And the Tree means a branching structure.
				<br>
				<br>
				Sideway triangles are an html element, each has an open and closing tag, and it can include a text or another element/branch.
				<br>
				<br>
				To mark the box so you can remember what it's for, and to add style is to give each element a class attribute. A box can also belong to multiple classes.

</div>
			<div class="paragraph3">
				Boxifying: dividing/cutting the webpage into boxes within boxes. This is how the browser sees HTML.
			</div>
</div>
<div class="chapter">
			<h2 class="chapter_Title">Notes on Chapter Three</h2>
			<div class="paragraph1">
				<div>
					The HTML document starts with !DOCTYPE HTML to tell the browser that this is an HTML document.
					<br>
					<br>
					Then the HTML starts with html and ends with /html.
					<br>
					<br>
					After the HTML TAG we add the head /head Tag.
					<br>
					<br>
					Inside the head Tag we add the link to the CSS file.
					<br>
					<br>
					After the head Tag we add the body /body Tag.
				</div>
				<div>
					<img class="image" src="HTML.Gif" alt="this is an image" style="re">

			<div class="paragraph2">
				The Concept of Cascading: Rules are applied not only to the elements they directly match, but also their child elements, except if the child element has its own rule.
				<br>
				<br>
				The Concept of Inheritance: Mechanism by which properties are applied not only to specific element but also to its descendants, inheritance relies on the document tree/hierarchy. Only text related properties are inherited, Box related properties are not inherited.
				<br>
				<br>
				The Box Model: Margin; Border; Padding; Content.

			</div>
			<div class="paragraph3">
				It is very important in computer programming not to  REPEAT YOURSELF - Avoid repetition.
				<br>
				<b>CSS</b> assist programmers to avoid repetition.
				<br>
				Repeated codes are very hard to maintain.
				<br>
				Writing your style inline with your HTML is not a very good idea because it leads to a lot of repeated codes and you will need to modify the code in every individual element if you decided to make a change or fix an error.
